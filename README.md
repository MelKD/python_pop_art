# Create pop art images with Python and OpenCV
The idea of this program is to use Python and OpenCV to manipulate individual colour channels on a series of images, to create pop art images inspired by artist Andy Warhols Marilyn Monroe images (see here: https://www.moma.org/collection/works/portfolios/61240)

The program will take the argument for a single image from the command line and generate a series of images stylised to resemble 'pop art'. When the program is run it will display the images and save the output as individual images in the folder where the program is located.

## USAGE: 
Example: python images.py --image images/image1.jpg 

## Dependencies:
This program can be run from the command line, and assumes that OpenCV and Python are installed and accessible from the folder in which the program is run.
